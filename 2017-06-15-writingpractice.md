In these times of discontent, is there anyone more discontented than the current President of the United States, Donald Trump. Nothing he actually does will ever live up to the hype and hyperbole he spews on every topic.

He lays claim to successes that are not his own. He disavows his own statements and projects his shortcomings onto those he perceives as hostile. If you are not for him, you are against him. There is no middle ground for reflection or for consideration.
