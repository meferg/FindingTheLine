# Test 3
## So, I was wondering if Workflowy supports Markdown. I don't think it does because Workflowy uses several characters for its tagging that are also used by Markdown such as the hashtag.

Further, I'm not sure how I would test it. I guess I could write Markdown here, but then have to copy and paste to move the content to something that processes Markdown like GitHub Pages or Atom.

That could be an interesting test.
